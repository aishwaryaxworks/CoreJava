static -> non access specifier


Two block types = 1. static 	2. instance
	syntax -> static{   }     {     }
# static block is declared outside all methods, instance blocks is declared 
inside the methods.
# blocks are declared so that the statements inside the block dont need objects 
to be created to call them.


array -> container storing similar type of data in a single unit.
# has fixed size
syntax -> datatype[] reference_Name;	"Variables" also called "reference"
Accepted norms:
	String variableName[];		|
	String[] variableName[];	|Single dimension array
	String []variableName;		|

value assigning -> 
datatype[] reference_name={"abc","xyz","pql"};
#comma separated value initialization.
#two dimensional array = a[][];

operations: create, delete, read and update
array is index based


accountHolder[]={"",""} -> gives fully qualified address/name (stored reference address of 
the array where the memory of 0th index is stored) -> accountHolder is pointing to
fully qualified address which stores the 0th index value.

.length = gives size of array

to access the data from array ->
accountHolder[1] => referenceName[index]


Errors => during compilation
exceptions => during execution / running code
